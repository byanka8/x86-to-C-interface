### MP Specs
The kernel must calculate the distances between the coordinate points accross two vectors.
- Required to use functional scalar SIMD registers
- Required to use functional scalar SIMD floating-point instructions

### Comparative Execution time and short analysis of the performance of the kernels
Upon running the computations and timing both kernels, it is evident that the execution time in Assembly is significantly faster than in C. This is due to the low-level nature of Assembly, allowing more direct control over hardware and optimizations.
